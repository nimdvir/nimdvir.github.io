Engagement is too often a proxy for "time spent." For research and civic uses, we need metrics that privilege informed decision-making over stickiness.

## The pyramid of intent

- **Exposure:** Did the right people see it? (reach, qualified impressions)
- **Comprehension:** Did they understand it? (read depth, clarity checks)
- **Action:** Did it prompt a useful step? (form completion, plan creation)
- **Reflection:** Did beliefs or strategies update? (self-report, follow-ups)

## Signals worth capturing

- **Quality time:** focus-weighted dwell (discounts idle tabs), scroll stability, and return visits within 24h for the same topic.
- **Clarity loops:** number of clarifying questions asked, and whether confidence in understanding rises after system explanations.
- **Constructive disagreement:** respectful counter-arguments posted, edits after reading opposing evidence, and cross-faction replies that stay civil.
- **Outcome alignment:** goal creation -> action -> confirmation (e.g., booked appointment, filed request, shared source with a peer).

## Instrumentation tips

1. Tag flows by intent at design time (inform, decide, request help). Avoid one-size-fits-all events.
2. Pair quantitative signals with lightweight prompts: "Did this answer help you decide?" with Yes/No + short reason.
3. Track the "two-hop" effect: did a user share a source or explanation with someone else?
4. Respect privacy: aggregate and anonymize by default; make sensitive event capture opt-in.

## Example scorecard

- Topic comprehension: +18% after adding inline summaries.
- Clarifying questions per session: down 12% (better initial framing).
- Decision completion for benefit applications: up 9% with checklists.
- Constructive replies between differing groups: up 6% after moderation cues.

Engagement that matters is intentional: it is defined by the user's goal and measured by how reliably they achieve it without unnecessary friction.
