Students already encounter AI-generated content outside the classroom. We can use the same tools to strengthen critical reading, attribution, and civic dialogue -- if we scaffold them carefully.

## Pilot setup

- Small groups, 45-minute sessions, laptops shared 2:1.
- Topics: algorithmic bias in hiring, local environmental policy, and media framing of public safety.
- Tooling: retrieval-augmented chatbot with curated sources; logging enabled to review questions and answers.

## Activities

1. **Source critique drills.** Students ask for summaries, then must request and evaluate citations. They label each source as factual, persuasive, or speculative.
2. **Argument swap.** Teams generate arguments on one side, swap devices, and use the AI to strengthen the opposing view. Reflection: what changed your mind?
3. **Signal tracing.** Students ask the AI to explain why it ranked certain sources higher. They compare to their own ranking and note disagreements.

## What worked

- Students quickly learned to demand citations and spotted when the AI hedged without evidence.
- Argument swap lowered defensiveness; students spent more time interpreting opposing positions.
- Facilitators could project anonymized questions to guide a meta-discussion on quality queries.

## Constraints to respect

- Use a closed corpus to avoid unsafe content and keep attributions inspectable.
- Log interactions transparently and delete after grading.
- Disclose limitations plainly: "The assistant cannot verify local facts in real time."

AI should not replace primary sources or peer debate. It can, however, act as a responsive sparring partner -- one that students learn to question, cite, and correct. That may be the most valuable civic lesson of all.
