Two years have passed since **Julia Louis-Dreyfus** was diagnosed with breast cancer. She shared her recovery process with her followers while simultaneously filming the final season of the comedy *Veep*. In an interview, she discusses the connection between comedy and politics and admits: "Being a middle-aged woman trying to remain relevant and influential is a struggle."

The past year was far from full of smiles for Julia Louis-Dreyfus, a woman who usually approaches life with constant humor. "When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I started crying," she says of the discovery of the malignant disease in her body in 2017.

It's not easy to see a comedian in tears, but Dreyfus, after completing six chemotherapy treatments and surgery, already sounds and looks recovered. "The treatments and surgery were very difficult. I felt sick to the depths of my soul, but I always knew I was going to get through it, that I had to get through it."

"Obviously, cancer makes you think. We are not the same when we see the end right in front of our eyes. I saw death. You could say that before the illness I was much more lighthearted, but the illness made me realize that lightheartedness is not something I can afford anymore. It's not that I'm 'heavy,' I'm just much more awake and goal-oriented."

Dreyfus, who shared her journey with her fans on social media, said this week in an interview with *Good Morning America*: "I think I reached a lot of people. I raised a lot of money for women who underwent mastectomies and reconstruction. Everyone's support helped me get through the chemo. And now, I'm completely back."

Next week, she returns to the screen for the seventh and final season of the political comedy she stars in, *Veep*. "I didn't have a doubt for a second that this season would make it to the screen," she says. "If anything, the cancer gave me motivation. They say humor is the best medicine, and it's not a cliche. I needed the laughter in my life, that purpose."

## The Art of the "Horrible" Character

Since first bursting onto the scene as Elaine Benes in *Seinfeld*, Dreyfus (58) has become one of the most respected actresses in history, with a record-breaking number of Emmy Awards — nine for *Seinfeld*, six of them for her acting — and other accolades. After several seasons on *The New Adventures of Old Christine*, she stepped into the shoes of the seasoned politician Selina Meyer in the successful *Veep*. In the final season, her character is once again running for the U.S. presidency, surrounded by her incompetent staff and armed with a cynical outlook on life.

This season, Meyer tosses out a variety of inappropriate jokes about people with disabilities, victims of shooting attacks, the lower class, and anyone who crosses her path. All she cares about is the White House.

"You could say I've made a career out of playing quite horrible characters," Dreyfus laughs when we meet this week at a New York hotel. "But even when Meyer is truly horrible, I don't see it that way. She is very determined and very, very frustrated. There is something interesting about frustration. Behind it, there is a lot of sadness and ambition. It's much deeper than just being 'horrible.' So she takes her frustration out on everyone around her."

"It cracks me up how she talks to people. For example, her line rebuking an employee who messed up: 'That's like using a croissant as a dildo — it doesn't do the job and it leaves a mess!'" she bursts out laughing.

**You talk about her as if she's a real person.** "She exists. You see her everywhere around us. She's a combination of many men and women in politics and other industries. You could say this is also a show about Hollywood, not just Washington. A show about selfish people trying to promote themselves in every possible way."

**How much are you like Selina?** "A lot, tons," she laughs. "Mostly I can identify with her. I understand her frustration — being a woman who is busy all day with how to sell her brand. I do the same thing. There's a lot of similarity between surviving in politics and surviving in showbiz. Being a middle-aged woman trying to remain relevant and influential — I definitely understand the feeling. When people across from you think you've lost your touch and you should go home, or when they don't take you seriously — it's infuriating."

**Do you, in your position, still feel that way?** "Yes. I always felt like I had to fight. It was hard for me to get the ability to produce my own materials. I fought very hard for creative control. There was a lot of pressure against me, but in the end, I won."

## Leadership and "The Sausage Factory"

Dreyfus is the undisputed boss of the show. The entire crew is at her feet — showering her with endless compliments and holding their breath when she walks on set. And yet, she seems to work harder than anyone.

At the hotel where the interview takes place, she has been there since seven in the morning, non-stop. Skipping between interviews with media from around the world, conferring with the show's producers, and finalizing edits for the upcoming episodes.

Dreyfus takes off her high heels and remains barefoot. She sits next to the producer in the hotel hallway, watching clips on a laptop screen — and giving editing instructions. "I hear 'uhm' too many times," she remarks, suggesting a scene be shortened. From there, she continues her round of interviews, showing not a hint of fatigue.

"A good leader is someone who manages to lead by example," says Tony Hale, who plays her right-hand man, Gary, in the series. "Julia is like that. She is never 'off.' She never has a bad day. And even if she does, you'll never know. She comes to work."

Dreyfus is modest: "I think we all try to do the best we can. This is absolutely not just my show. Everyone works very hard."

**How does your role as a producer manifest itself?** "It's a role that never ends. I'm involved in everything. At least I've changed. In the past, I used to watch every scene filmed on a given day, like a person possessed, but I learned to let go. When I used to watch myself, I'd be filled with self-criticism, loathing, and shame. Today, I'm no longer that hard on myself."

**Why are you ending it now?** "It was a decision made by me and the producers. The network was ready to let us continue, but I felt the show had run its course. We are finishing at the point where I think we should finish."

**Is there a connection to the fact that reality itself has become satirical to a degree that exceeds the scripts?** "Given the current climate, it's much more challenging to try to break comedic boundaries. On the other hand, we have always operated the show without addressing the political identity of the characters. None of them are defined as being on a specific side of the political aisle... Donald Trump isn't funny to me. I mean, he could have been funny if he didn't have the power he has."

**I understand you aren't a big fan of the current president.** "To put it mildly. It's reflected in everything he does. He's a 'make-believe' president, pretending."

## The Legacy of Elaine and Beyond

She wasn't originally supposed to be in *Seinfeld*. The idea was to make a show entirely of men, but NBC insisted on including a female character — and Elaine felt like an unwanted addition at first.

"It took me time to find my place," she says of her days on the legendary series. "The truth is that for years I felt they didn't give me jokes with 'meat' there. I had jokes, but they weren't as strong as the men's, in my opinion." And yes, she admits that at times she felt like she was in a boys' club. "I often heard Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld say they write Elaine as if she were a guy."

In designing the character, she aimed to be a voice for women in comedy. Dreyfus is known as a mentor to successful comedians of the new generation, such as Amy Schumer or Abbi Jacobson from *Broad City*.

Dreyfus downplays this: "I don't think I 'held the door' for anyone... Every woman earns her place honestly. I do see progress in the entertainment industry. There are many more roles for women in comedy than there were 20 or 30 years ago. There are roles that aren't just being 'the wife of' or the pretty girlfriend."

**Jerry Seinfeld previously said political correctness is nonsense and "anti-comedy." Do you agree?** "Not at all. I'm in favor of political correctness. I'd say I'm even a bit suspicious of people who oppose it. I think they are basically saying it's okay to tell racist jokes or jokes about violence against women. That is absolutely not okay."

## Wealth, Family, and Heritage

Gossip has often labeled Louis-Dreyfus as the heiress to a massive fortune, a descendant of a billionaire family. Her father, William, managed the Louis Dreyfus Group between 1996 and 2006.

"The media reports about my father's wealth are greatly exaggerated," she defends. "They love to write that he's a billionaire, and about me, they often write that I'm an heiress to billions. That is absolutely not the case. Far from it." On the other hand, while her father may not have left behind billions when he passed away a decade ago, one cannot argue with the fact that it is a very wealthy family.

Last summer, her sister, Emma, passed away at the age of 44. The cause of death was officially ruled a "seizure," but reports soon surfaced that quantities of cocaine and alcohol were found in her system. Louis-Dreyfus kept silent out of respect for her sister. "It was a very, very difficult time for all of us, shocking even. I didn't feel it was right to talk about it with the media," she explained.

**What is your opinion of Israel?** "I've never been there, but I would very much like to visit. My grandfather is Jewish, but I don't identify as Jewish. It's part of my heritage, of the mosaic that makes up my identity, but there are other parts too."

Dreyfus insists she is less of a workaholic than Selina, but not by much. She recently finished filming a movie with Will Ferrell and is now looking for her next challenge.

"There is no TV on the horizon right now, but I'm open to suggestions," she answers with a smile. "I won't say 'no' to a good script."

**Would you do political comedy again?** "I don't think so. I learned a lot about politics from this show. Overall, I realized that politicians are just people. That's all. On one hand, it's comforting, and on the other hand, it's terrifying, considering they have to run the show. It's like visiting a sausage factory — you don't really want to see how they're made."
