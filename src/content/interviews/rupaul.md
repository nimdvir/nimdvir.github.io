**After reality shows focused on music, design, and modeling, comes the show that will crown America's next drag superstar. Nimrod Dvir interrupted RuPaul, the show's host, in the middle of an office party to talk about eyelashes, lipstick, and Tyra Banks.**

The conversation with RuPaul, whom I am interviewing for the launch of his new television show "RuPaul's Drag Race" in Israel (on yes stars real), opened in a strange way. When I called his office located in New York, I was met with a barrage of shrieks and hysterical laughter, as if I had invaded a wild drag party.

I already began to imagine RuPaul—the most famous drag queen in the United States, active for more than 25 years—sitting with sequins on the telephone receiver and a feather boa draped over the dial.

**What are you doing there?** "Nothing, we’re just relaxing, resting, and looking g-o-r-g-e-o-u-s," he says in his coaxing voice. "The truth is, we’re laughing at the journalist who just interviewed me. I’ve been doing interviews for 300 years, and I can tell you, there are journalists who shouldn't be there. He asked me if I identify with the goals of some gay charity I’m performing for next week. Damn, what should I tell him? That I have no idea what this organization does? That they hire me, I perform, I leave, and goodbye?"

"Years ago, I would have faked it, babbled something about how it’s so important for gay people to help gay people. But now I just say 'fuck that.' I prefer to be real."

### On the Beach

RuPaul, a machine gun of catchphrases, can afford to talk dirty about journalists. Since RuPaul Andre Charles burst into the public consciousness in the early nineties, the 48-year-old queen has managed to do it all: massive performances, hosting series and broadcasts, appearing in movies, leading campaigns, recording albums (including the hit "Supermodel"), and writing a successful biography.

Now, as mentioned, he is launching "RuPaul's Drag Race" in Israel, where he presides over a group of drag performers who want to be America's next drag superstar. "For years they wanted me to do this show, but I didn't agree," he says. "I didn't get a promise that there wouldn't be malice. I would never laugh *at* contestants on the show. I respect the art of drag too much. This time, the production is by friends of mine, and I knew the idea would be safe with them."

**And yet, your contestants are sometimes ridiculous, especially when they scream that they’ve run out of makeup.** "There is a thin line between laughing *at* someone and laughing *with* someone. A while ago, I did a project with writers I’m not used to. They tried to write jokes for me, and I had to tell them—my sweets, I’m juicy, but I’m not a bitch. People don’t understand the difference."

**What is "juicy" about the show?** "I’m proud that we managed to create a show that shows drag as an amazing art. The show shows that our body is a temporary thing. You are not a man, or a woman, or black or white. You are not your religion, or your car, or your hair. You are born naked, and the rest is drag. This is the reason why this art has survived through the generations. Drag reminds people that there are no rules, that we determine everything, and that you can bend reality and have fun. That’s why cultures oppose it, because people don’t want to wake up from their dream."

**Throughout the show, you refer to the contestants with female pronouns. Why is that?** "Stop, we are in the 21st century. It’s so meaningless. I call the contestants 'girls' because I respect them. Besides, we need to laugh; life is for us to enjoy."

**The comparison to Tyra Banks' show ("America's Next Top Model") is inevitable.** "You can compare them. It's a reality show, with girls competing to stay or leave. But that's it. The only similarity is the humor and the synthetic hair."

**And the nails.** "We had small fights, but no crazy 'bitch fights.' Seeing someone create something out of nothing—that's the drama. The real challenge is seeing these creative entertainers doing something together. In that sense, we are more similar to 'Project Runway,' because the drama is in the creation, not in fighting over who took whose mascara."

### Eyelashes to Pieces

The show, which airs in the United States on the gay network "Logo," is considered a great success. It was recently renewed there for a second season, and RuPaul is very proud of the matter. "Now is the casting stage," he says excitedly. "Do you want to come? Do you have lipstick?"

**I can buy some.** "Excellent. My word—if you come to New York, you’re in the show."

**Thank you very much. What else are you doing, besides filming?** "I’m on tour, promoting my latest album 'Champions' which was inspired by the show, and I’m also writing a book for women, which will contain all the drag secrets that real women need to know. It’s aimed at women who want to maximize their femininity."

**Go ahead, give them a tip.** "Here’s one on the house. Drag queens have a way of putting on false eyelashes. It’s hard to put them on in one piece. People put them on and look cross-eyed. That’s why many women avoid them. What you need to do is cut the eyelashes into four pieces, put glue on them, and then, using tweezers, place them on the real eyelashes. That way you get eyelashes that look real."

**Lovely. Tell me, are you single?** "Are you proposing? Just kidding. I’m a big believer in love. Everyone I’ve had a relationship with, I’m still in a relationship with. But no, right now I don’t have anyone. Everyone is in a relationship with me," he laughs.

**By the way, you were in Israel in 2003. Do you think the drag queens here have a chance to win your show?** "Absolutely. It’s a funny story. I arrived in Tel Aviv for the Pride events, and originally I was supposed to stay for one weekend. Of course, the airline lost my luggage, and it turned out well because in the end I stayed for ten days."

"I went on trips to Jerusalem, the Dead Sea—I wasn't ready for such a spiritual and moving experience. The funniest part I had there was that some girl recognized me on the street, invited me to her apartment, and I went. There were a lot of people sitting there smoking marijuana. It was a hysterical evening. To be honest, I didn't meet many queens at your place. I met Dana International, but she’s not a queen, she’s transsexual. I’m sure there are worthy candidates among you. All you need to be a queen is imagination, a love for beauty, and knowledge of pop culture. I’m sure there are Israeli kids with these qualities."
